- 👋 Hi, I’m @subzerothought
- 👀 I’m interested in modifying vintage amps to provide modern features like volume control, input selection and power on/off or even voice control...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to control devices through Arduino...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on code. I have very little experience in coding so this is a new journey. Any pointers to guide my way would be much appreciated....
- 📫 How to reach me: jimhaycock@ameritech.net. I am new to github also so STILL FINDING MY WAY AROUND.
